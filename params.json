It is compatible with AVR micro-controllers,\r\nincluding the famous Arduino boards.\r\n\r\n## Why not Arduino software ?\r\n\r\nArduino is a good framework and is quite simple to learn, but has a\r\nlimitation: you can use only one execution flow, which can be\r\nproblematic if you want to handle a lot of incoming events (GPIOs\r\nmodifications, timers, incoming byte on the serial port, etc).\r\n\r\nOctopus framework uses an event-queue to handle incoming events. As\r\na consequence the CPU stays in idle mode as long as no event arises.\r\nIf you want to simply blink a led, you just have to code an timer\r\nevent handler which will toggle the GPIO output, and start a timer\r\nfor 1 second with this event handler. \r\n\r\nAnother advantage of Octopus SDK is its remote control and telemetry\r\nframework. Simply change the type of your C++ variables to the\r\n`RemoteProperty` type, and you will be able to monitor and modify\r\nin real-time the variable with the GUI application *OctopusControlPanel*.\r\nThis application is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS X, and an\r\nAndroid version is coming.\r\n\r\n## Supported boards\r\n\r\nFor the moment, Octopus SDK is compatible with AVR ATmega328P, which\r\nis used in the following board:\r\n* Arduino Uno\r\n* Arduino Ethernet\r\n* Arduino Pro boards\r\n* Arduino BT\r\n* LilyPad Arduino\r\n* Arduino Fio\r\n* Arduino Pro\r\n* Arduino Nano\r\n* Arduino Mini\r\n* Arduino Pro Mini\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (C) 2010-2012 PRISCAL Cedric\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
